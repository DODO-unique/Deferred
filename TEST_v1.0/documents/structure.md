structure.md for TEST_v1.0/

touch-engine-dock

goals:
1. Set up a main DB. This DB has one table. The table contains stored deferrs. Minimal DB work.
2. Set up a dock. This takes packet, takes enums from it, resolves these enums into tasks, does the task.  enum has CRUD (for now), only create would have operation state though, others will follow. v2 would support Read and Delete, v3 would support Update. Enum will be a different file, each resolving to a function, the function is carried out in Dock itself
3. Engine works wiht operation states. Defines "create" state. Simple working instructions for Dock.
4. Engine picks data passed by dock. Converts it into reliable information, forwards carefully yo touch
5. Touch remains a naive ORM layer. Logs loudly. Logging defined by engine.

Engine's tasks in TEST_v1.0:
    1. Log
    2. operation state - pydantic + shared state (for now, later DB)
    3. I/O with touch and dock.

DB table schema example:
```sql
DROP TYPE IF EXISTS enum_status;
CREATE TYPE enum_status AS ENUM ('pending', 'sent', 'failed');

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS users (
    id INT GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY PRIMARY KEY,
    userID UUID NOT NULL DEFAULT uuidv7(),
    payload JSONB NOT NULL,
    execute_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT now(),
    deferred_status enum_status NOT NULL DEFAULT 'pending',
    contact_id  JSONB NOT NULL
);
```

The idea of this version is to be employable to a JS hook and minimal HTML frontend. We are working only on the spina cord. We will add layers over it as the versions advance.

The endpoints are very immature in this version, we will make sure the next version works on that- probably 1.1
