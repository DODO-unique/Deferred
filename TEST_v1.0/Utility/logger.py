# ------------ This entire section is subject to revision during documentation ----------


# suggestion, try storing it as logs when importing elsewhere. Like `logs = Hebu.entry`, then going logs("Heyo!"). Wait, let me add that here itself:
'''logs = Hebu.entry'''
# now, simply `from main import logs` or better:
def loggy(local, log: str) -> None:
    Hebu.entry(local=local, log=log)
# same thing, but no one dies during debugging.


# this is mandatory for every file to define before using the logger.
def _log(log:str):
    loggy("control", log)
